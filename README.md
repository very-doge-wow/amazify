Migrate your playlists from Amazon Music to Spotify using a simple Flask web interface.

## Setup and Startup

### üîë Spotify Authentication via OAuth

Navigate to [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and
create a new app. Use this as the callback URL:

```shell
http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback
```

Retrieve your client id and client secret for later use.

### üîë Amazon Authentication (Workaround)

Currently, the Amazon Music API won't let us create applications for OAuth
ourselves without them needing to be approved by Amazon. Since we only want
to perform a one-time migration, we can obtain an OAuth token via Amazon's
own interactive API reference, hence eliminating  the need for us to be able
to create our own application.

Navigate to [dashboard.music.amazon.dev](https://dashboard.music.amazon.dev/console/api/get-playlist/)
and press the button `Get Token` in order to retrieve a valid token.
Login using your Amazon Music profile's credentials when prompted.

Copy the resulting token and set it as environment variable as described in
the next step. Make sure to also copy the `x-api-key` value as provided in
the example `curl` command given on Amazon's interactive API reference as well.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Required Environment Variables

Next set these environment variables. Get the client id and client
secret from the spotify app you have just created.

```shell
# client id and client secret of your spotify application
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=XXX
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=XXX
# token and x-api-key from the interactive amazon API reference
export AMAZON_TOKEN=XXX
# example: amzn1.application.72b599tbc0b549339095eb1234c3c7d1
export AMAZON_X_API_KEY=XXX
```

### üîß Installation of Dependencies

Install the dependencies using pipenv:

```shell
pipenv install
```

### üöÄ Startup

Start the flask server like this:

```shell
pipenv run python -m flask run
```

You can then open the webinterface under the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
Press the button for authenticating at Spotify before running any migration.
Errors will be printed in the Flask app's log, if any occurred.

| üí° | Try to verify the status code of the reponses from the Amazon/Spotify API using the log before opening an issue. Refreshing the credentials will most likely resolve the issue. |

## üöß Caveats

The following limitations exist:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
1. Do **not** run multiple migrations simultaneously. This will probably result in rate-limits being exceeded and the progress bar breaking.
2. The Amazon token will expire after about `30min`. Keep that in mind when running migrations.
3. The app does **not** check if a playlist with the same name already exists. A new playlist is created each time you start a migration.
4. If a song from the Amazon Playlist is not present in Spotify, the Spotify Search API might return false songs, which will then be added to the playlist. Make sure to check the result after the migration has finished.
